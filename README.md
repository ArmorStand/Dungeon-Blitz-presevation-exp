> **Important:** By default, Firefox is set for automatic updates. To prevent Firefox from automatically updating itself after you install an older version, you'll need to change your Firefox update settings: Click the menu button (三) and select *Options*. In the *General* panel, go to the *Firefox Updates* section.
> 
> **Important:** By default, Flash is disabled in Chromium. You need to enable Flash in Chromium settings.

> [Basilisk Browser](https://www.basilisk-browser.org/), which fully supports all NPAPI plugins (i.e. Flash). It's a fork of the Mozilla/Firefox code.
